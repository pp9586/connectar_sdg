# Food Waste Management Project

## Overview
The Food Waste Management project aims to tackle the issue of food waste by collecting excess or leftover food from donors like hotels, restaurants, and marriage halls and distributing it to those in need. This project provides a streamlined and efficient platform to ensure that surplus food reaches the hungry rather than being wasted.

## Features
